This is a small demo introducing a clustering algorithm which can be used to cluster 2-D points into different groups without knowing how many categories before clustering.

The original idea is from Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio, check out their paper published on Science: <a href = 'http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/344/6191/1492.full.pdf'>Link</a>

This program is based on my understanding with the paper. It might be different from the program created by paper authors.


Demo shows below:
